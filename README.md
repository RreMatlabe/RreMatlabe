# Hi, I'm Katlego Matlabe 👋
### GRC Analyst | Customer Success Specialist | Governance Graduate

**"Bridging the gap between human-centric service and rigid compliance frameworks."**

### 🚀 About This Portfolio
Welcome to my professional repository. While most GitHub profiles showcase code, this repository showcases **Operational Autonomy**, **Risk Documentation**, and **Strategic Account Management**.

I am transitioning from a high-volume independent consultancy (managing **5,600+ unique clients** globally) into **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**.

This repository serves as a "Proof of Work" for my ability to:
1.  **Analyze Risk:** Documenting incidents and aligning with NIST frameworks.
2.  **Retain Clients:** Managing churn and satisfaction at a massive scale.
3.  **Document Everything:** Using version control and structured reporting for business continuity.

### 📂 Featured Case Study: The Retention Strategy

**The Challenge:** How do you manage 11,000+ sessions across 4 time zones with zero supervision?
**The Solution:** I developed a "Trusted Advisor" framework that resulted in:
*   **5,619** Unique Accounts Managed.
*   **4-Year** Retention on top-tier accounts.
*   **99%** Reliability rating over 5,000+ service hours.

*This deck breaks down the data, the methodology, and the specific "Save Strategies" used to prevent churn.*
