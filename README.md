# Hi, I'm Katlego Matlabe 👋
### Technical Onboarding Specialist | GRC Analyst | Customer Success

**"Bridging the gap between human-centric service and technical compliance."**

### 🚀 About This Portfolio
Welcome to my professional repository. While most GitHub profiles showcase code, this repository showcases **Operational Autonomy**, **Risk Documentation**, and **Technical Readiness**.

I am transitioning from a high-volume independent consultancy (managing **5,600+ unique clients** globally) into **Technical Operations and GRC**.

This repository serves as a "Proof of Work" for my ability to:
1.  **Analyze Risk:** Documenting incidents and aligning with NIST frameworks.
2.  **Retain Clients:** Managing churn and satisfaction at a massive scale.
3.  **Troubleshoot Infrastructure:** Understanding the hardware and network layers that impact user adoption.

### 📂 Featured Case Study: The Retention Strategy

**The Challenge:** How do you manage 11,000+ sessions across 4 time zones with zero supervision?
**The Solution:** I developed a "Trusted Advisor" framework that resulted in:
*   **5,619** Unique Accounts Managed.
*   **4-Year** Retention on top-tier accounts.
*   **99%** Reliability rating over 5,000+ service hours.

*This deck breaks down the data, the methodology, and the specific "Save Strategies" used to prevent churn.*
