### 🚀 About This Portfolio
Welcome to my professional repository. While most GitHub profiles showcase code, this repository showcases **Operational Autonomy**, **Risk Documentation**, and **Strategic Account Management**.

I am transitioning from a high-volume independent consultancy (managing **5,600+ unique clients** globally) into **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**.

This repository serves as a "Proof of Work" for my ability to:
1.  **Analyze Risk:** Documenting incidents and aligning with NIST frameworks.
2.  **Retain Clients:** Managing churn and satisfaction at a massive scale.
3.  **Document Everything:** Using version control and structured reporting for business continuity.
