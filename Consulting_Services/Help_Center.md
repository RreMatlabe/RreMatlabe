## 2. The "Golden Article" Template
*Standardized format to ensure consistency across all documentation.*

### [Sample Article] Configuring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Who is this for?** Workspace Admins
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Time required:** 5-10 minutes

### Why use RBAC?
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to restrict access based on a user's role within your organization. This ensures that sensitive data is only visible to authorized personnel, helping you meet **SOC2** and **GDPR** requirements.

### Prerequisites
*   You must be an **Admin** or **Owner** of the AyrCloudSync workspace.
*   You must have a list of user emails ready to assign.

### Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Navigate to the Admin Console**
Log in to your dashboard and click the **Settings Gear ⚙️** in the bottom left corner. Select **"Organization Settings."**

**2. Define your Roles**
Click on the **"Roles & Permissions"** tab. By default, AyrCloudSync offers three roles:
*   **Viewer:** Read-only access.
*   **Editor:** Can upload and modify files.
*   **Admin:** Full control over users and billing.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** We recommend following the *Principle of Least Privilege*. Give users the lowest level of access necessary to do their job.

**3. Assign Users to Roles**
1.  Go to the **"Members"** tab.
2.  Check the box next to the user(s) you want to modify.
3.  Click **"Change Role"** and select the appropriate level from the dropdown menu.
4.  Click **Save**.

### Troubleshooting
*   **"I can't see the Admin Console":** Ensure you are logged in with an account that has Admin privileges.
*   **"Changes aren't saving":** Clear your browser cache or try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5).

## 3. Strategic Value
*Why this structure works:*
1.  **Deflects Tickets:** The "Prerequisites" section stops unqualified users from emailing support about features they don't have access to.
2.  **Builds Trust:** Using GRC terminology (SOC2, GDPR, Least Privilege) positions AyrCloudSync as a secure, enterprise-grade partner.
3.  **Scalable:** The "Bucket" structure allows for infinite new articles without cluttering the home page.
